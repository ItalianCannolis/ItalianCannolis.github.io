        <h3 class="titleH3">Project Summary:</h3>
        <p>Tower of Ash is a rogue-lite metroidvania game made over 12 weeks for the course of IAT 410 Advanced Game Design</p>
        <p>The player is awakened at the base of the Tower of Ash and is told by a mysterious voice to ascend the tower, along the way they also get new abilities and fight tougher enemies that impede them</p>

        <p>The team’s goal for this project was to develop a game far more complicated than anything we could attempt within a week. Forcing us to consider factors like load times, multiple level design themes and even saving progress.</p>
        
        <section id="LevelDesigner">
          <h3 class="titleH3">Level Designer:</h3>
          <p>Since this project was much longer than anything I had ever worked on before I had more room to expand upon the level design. The game is divided into 3 levels: the Tower Base, Ember’s Rise and the Vermillion Summit. This was done to create a clear sense of progression within the game not just visually but also in terms of mechanics.</p>
          <p>Each area aside from the Vermilion Summit (which only has one) has two abilities that the player must acquire that are crucial for performing the platforming necessary to progress to the next area. This was done to get the player to master their new abilities before being put into harder challenges above.</p>
          <p>Each section also has their own unique platforming element beyond just the new abilities for the character. In the Tower Base, I introduce basic spikes and teach the importance of precision jumps. In Ember’s Rise, I introduce swinging platforms that move in an arc motion emphasizing the importance of timing so as not to miss the platform. In the Vermilion Summit, I created falling platforms that disappear after a short duration of the player stepping on them, this highlights speed as the player is near the top and must make it there.</p>

          </div>
          <p>All of this being considered and the fact that the player is on a time limit every run. The tower was divided into three paths the player can take to reach the top. The left and right paths can be taken from the beginning so long as the player has the required abilities to progress through to the next area, however they are quite lengthy and inefficient. This leads to the design of the middle path, it’s the fastest path of the three but to prevent the player from constantly relying on just the middle path, they must first flip switches to open the doors that block the middle path, these switches are on the left and right paths, emphasizing exploration.</p>

          <h3 class="titleH3">Programmer:</h3>
          <p>Stemming from level design, a lot of the programming I did was based around it. In particular the moving platforms used in the second section of the game onward. One of the things I had to consider greatly when programming them was their variability. If I wanted the level design to feel unique I was going to need to be able to adjust the path of the swinging platform as well as many other aspects from the Unity Editor.</p>

          <img src="img/TOA/Platform_Serialized.PNG" alt="The early room design blocked out in comparison to the image next to it" width="450" height="450">
          <p>This was done by putting the variables I needed in serialized fields, so that they could be adjusted in the editor. I also used gizmos to denote the two end points of the arc as well as a third gizmo to denote the apex. This allowed me to visualize the path in the editor without excessive amounts of micro adjustments during testing.</p>

          <p>However the primary programming I did as a whole was reflected in the level design through the process of additive loading. The bulk of the work was done via the use of Unity’s trigger system, when a player would enter the trigger it loaded in the connected rooms’ scene and unloads the rooms’ scene without a direct connection to the room the player was currently in.</p>
          <p>The scenes would be loaded and unloaded asynchronously to allow for fluid gameplay. This worked very well at the start however it led to respawning enemies as each time the scene was reloaded so were the enemies.</p>
          <p>This led to the removal of enemies from the scenes themselves and creating enemy spawners that contain the enemy to spawn and its position, each spawner for a room is put into a list for the trigger to reference.</p>
          <img src="img/TOA/Additive_Loading.PNG" alt="The early room design blocked out in comparison to the image next to it" width="806" height="418">

          <p>This way each room doesn’t respawn enemies that had been defeated in a run improving optimization. The spawners also run off of a coroutine during room spawn allowing for smooth gameplay even when the player moves between rooms.</p>

          <h3 class="titleH3">Reflection:</h3>
          <p>Tower of Ash is the project that brings me the most pride to date. It taught me so many new things and really pushed my skills as a level designer and as a programmer forward. Even whilst it’s not a perfect game, Tower of Ash shows my ability to adapt on the fly and that alone gives me a lot of confidence for future projects.</p>
