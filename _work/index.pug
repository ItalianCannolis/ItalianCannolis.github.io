	Pug (pugjs.org/) is a preprocessing language for HTML. It has it's own syntax, meaning you would have to learn another laguage to work with it effectively. There are some advantages to working with a language like pug though: 
	- templating ability 
	- more legible/simpler markup
	- HTML compression 
	- error prevention
	- reusable code
